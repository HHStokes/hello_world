# This program uses Python 3.8

This is a _very_ simple hello world program with the intention to practice   posting onto [GitHub](www.github.com)
and to document it using [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).   I have a feeling that I will edit this several times as I become more familiar with Markdown, Python, and GitHub.

## Execution

To run the program `hello_world.py`

You may open with [Python 3.8.](https://www.python.org/), however because there is nothing stopping it from closing   imediatly after opening you may open with with your development envornment of choice. I shall use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as that is what   I'm familar with.

1. Make sure that [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) is installed and set up with your development envornment. VS Code  will suggest a python extension if Python is already installed. 

2. Set up a virtual envornment via the teminal (VS Code). This can be done via the following command "py -m venv venv" wich will make a copy of the current version of Python being used for the hello world program.

3. Run the program. this can be done by pressing  F5 or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging.

#### _Congragulations_! Assuming I made the instuctions correctly or the program works properly, the terminal should display:
